			<h2>Here's a short biography of Sir David</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sir David Attenborough was born on 8 May, 1926, in Isleworth, West London.
					<em>The same year as Queen Elizabeth II!</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					He was raised on the campus of University College, Leicester.
					Now the University of Leicester, where his dad was principal.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sir David doesn’t count himself as an animal ‘lover’.
					But instead says he has always been fascinated by them.
				</li>
				<li>
					He’s thrifty! At 11 years old he struck a deal selling newts to University College, Leicester for 3d (3 pence) each. The newts only came from a pond 5m away from the university’s zoology department!
				</li>
				<li>
					He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in black and white, colour, HD, and 3D.
				</li>
				<li>
					He doesn’t own a car as he never passed his driving test.
					He’s also not keen on sending emails, and prefers receiving letters by fax or post.
				</li>
				<li>
					During <strong>World War II</strong> his parents adopted two Jewish refugee girls from Europe. 
				</li>
				<li>
					There’s only one animal Sir David doesn’t like… 
					<em>Rats!</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					Sir David was rejected from the first job he ever applied for at the BBC.
					The position of radio talk producer.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 1947 he spent two years serving in the Royal Navy.
					Based in North Wales and the Firth of Forth.
				</li>
				<li>
					When Sir David got his first job in television, he didn’t even own a TV.
					<em>Like most British people at the time!</em>
				</li>
				<li>
				His first programme, called Coelacanth, looked at the rediscovery of the coelacanth – <em>a prehistoric fish.</em>
				</li>
				<li>
					Sir David has more than ten plants and animals named after him
					Such as the Nepenthes attenboroughii – a giant carnivorous plant that devours animals as large as rats – and the UK’s new polar research vessel, RRS Sir David Attenborough.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 1985 he received a knighthood. Granting him the title of <strong>Sir David Attenborough.</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					He’s thought to be one of the most well-travelled people on the planet.
					For The Life of Birds documentary, he travelled a whopping 256,000 miles – that’s the same as travelling around the world ten times!
